# Exec-cmds-defer-errors

Small Python script that executes given commands commands and defers errors.

The standalone script is called `exec_cmds_defer_errors.py` and can be found
[here](src/exec_cmds_defer_errors.py). The license is included in the file.

Here it is used to run three commands:

```sh
uv run --script exec_cmds_defer_errors.py \
  'whoami | grep goatse' \
  'echo "hello world"' \
  'make love'
```

Note that in the example the script is executed with `uv run`, a subcommand of
[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/), which is a package manager for Python. This is
because the script contains
[inline script metadata](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/inline-script-metadata/#inline-script-metadata)
specifying required dependencies. The script also contains a shebang, so it can
be executed directly.

The output will look like this:

## Shell completion

This program uses [Click](https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/) for the
CLI. Click provides automatically generated shell completion for Bash, Fish, and
Zsh. Check out the official documentation
[here](https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/shell-completion/).
